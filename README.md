# Open Source, Modifiable, C++ Console Movement Engine, Windows Only.

This is made in Visual Studio 2017 Community if any of you were wondering.

This movement engine is very modifiable as it includes many functions that will help you make your own players and bots. I am 13 and do not take coding class, this is my hobby. Please notify me if there is a bug or some advice you have for me. The .cpp file is commented if anyone is not that experienced in c++.

# This is my first project and I do not have much experience in c++.
