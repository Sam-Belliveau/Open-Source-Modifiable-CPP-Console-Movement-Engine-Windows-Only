# Open-Source-Modifiable-CPP-Console-Movement-Engine-Windows-Only
This movement engine is very modifiable as it includes many functions that will help you make your own players and bots. I am 13 and do not take coding class, this is my hobby. Please notify me if there is a bug or some advice you have for me. The .cpp file is commented if anyone is not that experienced in c++.

# This is my first project and I do not have much experience in c++.
